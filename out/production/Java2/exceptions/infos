In Java, exceptions can be categorized into two types:

Unchecked Exceptions: They are not checked at compile-time but at run-time.
For example:
ArithmeticException,
 NullPointerException,
  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, exceptions under Error class, etc.

Checked Exceptions: They are checked at compile-time.
For example:
 IOException,
 InterruptedException, etc.
