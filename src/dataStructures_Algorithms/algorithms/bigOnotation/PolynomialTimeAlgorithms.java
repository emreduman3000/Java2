        //The term polynomial is a general term which contains quadratic (n2), cubic (n3), quartic (n4), etc. functions. What's important to know is that O(n2) is faster than O(n3) which is faster than O(n4), etc.

        //Let's have a look at a simple example of a quadratic time algorithm:

        int n=5;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for(int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {

            }
        }
        //This algorithm will run 82 = 64 times. Note, if we were to nest another for loop, this would become an O(n3) algorithm.
